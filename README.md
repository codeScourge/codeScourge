## Hey, I'm Ivan
I started as an ML engineer at 14. At 16 I cofounded an AI-agency and taught myself to be a swiss-army-knife webdev and got ✨business knowledge✨. 
Currently catching up with modern ML and diving into RL - so getting to the edge of technology in my field and choosing my next endevour.

I am convinced that AI is going to change the world just like the industrial revolution has. This means that us engineers who have the vision and agency, will have to bring this revolution forward. If you are a company or individual with this mission, please reach out to me.
